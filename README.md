# JAD

JAD implements a variety of common data structures and algorithms "from scratch". When collections
such as lists, stacks and hash maps (and even `Collection`s) are needed, they are implemented using 
arrays rather than the convenient classes in `java.util`. 

JAD's primary purpose is education, specifically the learning and practice of implementing data 
structures and algorithms in plain Java. As such, many data structures have multiple implementations
such as a basic reference implementation, an alternative with better performance, and maybe another
alternative that is thread-safe, or that uses multi-threading internally.
